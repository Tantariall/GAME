An RPG/Incremental game inspired by everything.

You are a teenage boy, living in a terrible world, full of wars and gods. When your father died in a war, and a God killed your mother and newborn sister without any remorse, you swore to kill all the gods, all the humans, everyone. That was the only way to end the endless suffer. And you are not alone... Firstborn Power, Keeper of Fourth Dimension will share its powers with You.

...And shall the Black Flame cleanse these cursed lands.
